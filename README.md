```
@remington what's blocking this ticket?
```

**Remington responds (30-60 seconds later):**
```
Hi @john.doe! I've reviewed PROJ-456 and found the following blockers:

🚧 Current Blockers:
• Waiting on API endpoint design from backend team (mentioned in comment from Jan 3)
• Database schema needs approval from @tech-lead (flagged in description)

📋 Recent Activity:
• Last updated 2 days ago by @jane.smith
• Status: Blocked → waiting for dependencies
• No commits in last 5 days

💡 Recommendation:
1. Ping @backend-team in #engineering channel about API design
2. Schedule 15-min sync with @tech-lead for schema approval
3. Consider splitting frontend work into separate ticket to unblock progress

Would you like me to create follow-up tickets for the unblocked work?
```

#### Example: Slack Thread Interaction

**You post in #engineering:**
```
@Remington what's the status of PROJ-123?
```

**Remington responds in thread:**
```

## 📋 SLA Monitoring & Enforcement

Remington automatically monitors these Service Level Agreements:

| SLA Type | Target | What It Monitors | Escalation |
|----------|--------|------------------|------------|
| **Jira Comment Response** | 2 business days | Developer responses to stakeholder questions | 4-level escalation (comment → Slack → team → leadership) |
| **PR Review Turnaround** | 24-48 hours | Time from "Ready for Review" to first review | Slack notification to reviewer |
| **PR Code Activity** | 2 business days | PRs "In Progress" must show commits | Slack reminder to PR author |
| **Blocked Ticket Updates** | Daily | Tickets in "Blocked" status need daily updates | Daily Jira comment reminder |
| **Pending Approval Duration** | 48 hours | Tickets waiting for approval/sign-off | Slack notification to approver |

**Business Hours:**
- Default: Monday-Friday, 9 AM - 5 PM (configurable timezone)
- Holidays excluded (configurable in `.env`)
- SLA timers only count business hours

### 4-Level Escalation Matrix

When an SLA is violated, Remington escalates automatically:

| Level | Timing | Action | Where |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| **Level 1** | 0-1 days overdue | Friendly reminder | Jira comment only |
| **Level 2** | 1-2 days overdue | Direct request | Jira comment + Slack DM |
| **Level 3** | 2-3 days overdue | Team escalation | Jira + Slack + @tech-lead |
| **Level 4** | 3+ days overdue | Leadership alert | Jira + Slack + @leadership |

## 🤖 Automated Workflows

### Daily Standup (Weekdays at 9 AM)

Every weekday at 9 AM, Remington automatically posts a comprehensive standup report to your configured Slack channel. This report is the **heartbeat** of your sprint - it surfaces issues before they become blockers.

#### What Gets Analyzed

The standup workflow runs 5 sub-analyses:

1. **Code-Ticket Gap Detection** - Finds commits without associated Jira tickets (shadow work)
2. **Productivity Audit** - Reviews code complexity vs timesheet entries over last 7 days
3. **Team Capacity Analysis** - Checks if team is overloaded or underutilized
4. **SLA Compliance Check** - Lists all active violations and pending escalations
5. **Deadline Risk Assessment** - Flags tickets at risk of missing due dates

#### Example Daily Standup Report

**Posted to #standup channel at 9:00 AM:**

#### How It Works

**Automatic Execution:**
1. Cron job triggers at 9:00 AM (weekdays only)
2. Remington runs the standup orchestrator workflow
3. Gathers data from Jira, Bitbucket, and local git repositories
4. Analyzes SLA compliance, deadline risks, and team activity
5. Formats report and posts to configured Slack channel
6. Takes ~30-60 seconds total

**Manual Invocation:**
```bash
# Run standup report manually (useful for testing)
python run_agent.py standup

# Output will be posted to Slack
```

**Configuration:**
```bash
# In .env file
SLACK_CHANNEL_STANDUP=C123ABC456  # Channel ID for standup posts
BUSINESS_HOURS_START=9            # Report posts at this hour
BUSINESS_TIMEZONE=America/New_York
```

### Continuous Monitoring

Remington runs three concurrent monitoring systems:

**1. Webhook Listeners (Instant Response)**
- Jira webhooks: Comment events
- Bitbucket webhooks: PR events, comments
- FastAPI server on port 8000

**2. Polling Monitors (Backup + Slack)**
- **Slack**: Every 15 seconds (primary - Slack has no webhooks)
- **Jira**: Every 30 seconds (backup to webhooks)
- **Bitbucket**: Every 30 seconds (backup to webhooks)

**3. Scheduled Jobs (Daily/Hourly)**
- **Daily Standup**: Weekdays at 9 AM
- **SLA Checks**: Every hour
- **Sprint Analysis**: On-demand via `python run_agent.py sprint-analysis`

**Why the hybrid approach?**
- Webhooks can fail (network issues, misconfigurations)
- Polling ensures nothing is missed (3-day lookback after restart)
- Slack has no webhook support, requires polling

---

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **API Access:**
  - Atlassian account (Jira + Bitbucket)
  - Anthropic API key ([Get one](https://console.anthropic.com/))

## 🔧 Configuration

### Setting Up Webhooks (Recommended)

**Jira Webhooks:**
1. Go to Jira → Settings → System → Webhooks
2. Create webhook:
   - **URL**: `http://your-server:8000/webhooks/jira`
   - **Events**: Issue → commented
   - **JQL Filter**: `project = YOUR_PROJECT`

**Bitbucket Webhooks:**
1. Repository → Settings → Webhooks
2. Create webhook:
   - **URL**: `http://your-server:8000/webhooks/bitbucket`
   - **Events**: Pull request created/updated/commented

**Note:** Polling continues even with webhooks configured (belt-and-suspenders approach).

### Customizing SLAs

Edit `.env`:

```bash
# Business hours (SLA timers only run during these hours)
BUSINESS_HOURS_START=9
BUSINESS_HOURS_END=17
BUSINESS_TIMEZONE=America/New_York

# Holidays (comma-separated YYYY-MM-DD)
COMPANY_HOLIDAYS=2025-01-01,2025-05-26,2025-07-04,2025-12-25

# SLA Targets (in business days/hours)
JIRA_COMMENT_SLA_DAYS=2
PR_REVIEW_SLA_HOURS=48
```

See [`.claude/workflows/sla-monitoring.md`](.claude/workflows/sla-monitoring.md) for full SLA definitions.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Why We Don't Use MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**MCP was considered but rejected because:**

1. **Complexity Overhead** - MCP requires Node.js runtime, multiple server processes, and complex configuration
2. **Authentication Issues** - MCP servers have trouble with service account tokens and OAuth flows
3. **Limited Error Handling** - MCP abstraction makes debugging API issues harder
4. **Unnecessary Abstraction** - Direct REST API calls are simpler and more reliable
5. **Better Control** - Direct API access allows custom retry logic, rate limiting, and error handling

**Instead, we use:**
- ✅ **Direct Atlassian REST APIs** - Simple, well-documented, reliable
- ✅ **Custom bitbucket-cli** - Thin wrapper that handles auth and formatting
- ✅ **Claude API directly** - No intermediary layers, full control
- ✅ **Python requests library** - Standard, battle-tested HTTP client

This keeps the stack simple: `Python → REST APIs → Atlassian/Slack/Claude`

## 🔒 Security

### What Remington CAN Do:

✅ Read Jira tickets and comments
✅ Post Jira comments and @mention users
✅ Read Bitbucket PRs and commits
✅ Post PR review comments
✅ Post Slack messages
✅ Update Jira ticket status (via transitions)

### What Remington CANNOT Do:

❌ Modify code in repositories
❌ Commit or push changes
❌ Merge or approve PRs
❌ Delete Jira tickets
❌ Execute shell commands on your servers

**Best Practices:**
- Use a dedicated service account for Atlassian (not personal)
- Rotate API tokens every 90 days
- Never commit `.env` (already in `.gitignore`)
- Use read-only filesystem permissions where possible
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Service won't start:**
```bash
# Check Python version
python --version  # Must be 3.11+

# Verify dependencies installed
pip list | grep anthropic

# Check environment variables
python -c "from src.config import get_atlassian_config; print(get_atlassian_config())"
```

**Mentions not detected:**
- Verify Slack bot has `app_mentions:read` scope
- Check Jira webhooks are configured correctly
- Ensure bot account ID is in `.env`

**Database locked errors:**
```bash
# Kill zombie processes
pkill -f pm_agent_service

# Delete lock files if needed
rm -f .claude/data/bot-state/*.db-wal
rm -f .claude/data/bot-state/*.db-shm
```

**SLA violations not escalating:**
- Check business hours configuration in `.env`
- Verify holiday dates are in correct format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Run manual SLA check: `python run_agent.py sla-check`
