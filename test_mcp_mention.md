Test the Atlassian MCP addCommentToJiraIssue tool to understand its parameter format.

TASK:
Call the mcp__atlassian__addCommentToJiraIssue tool with these different attempts to understand what works:

**Attempt 1: Plain text with @username**
- issueIdOrKey: "ECD-617"
- body: "Test 1: Hello @Ethan, this is a plain text mention test."

Report back EXACTLY what parameter format the tool accepts and what the result was.

Do NOT post multiple comments - just try ONE format and report the tool signature.
