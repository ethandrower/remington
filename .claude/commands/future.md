# /future - Add Project Manager Improvement Idea

You are helping to plan and document a future improvement for **this project** (the CiteMed Project Manager autonomous agent).

## Your Task

1. **Understand the Improvement Idea:**
   - Ask clarifying questions if the user's idea is vague
   - Understand the goal, problem being solved, and desired outcome
   - Consider how it fits with existing agent capabilities

2. **Plan & Refine:**
   - Break down the idea into concrete implementation steps
   - Identify which files would need to be modified
   - Consider dependencies and prerequisites
   - Estimate effort (hours/days)
   - Determine priority level (High/Medium/Low)

3. **Add to FUTURE_WORK.md:**
   - Read the existing `.claude/FUTURE_WORK.md` file
   - Find the appropriate section (High/Medium/Low Priority)
   - Format the entry to match existing style with:
     - **Goal:** Clear objective statement
     - **Problem Statement:** What pain point this addresses (if applicable)
     - **Implementation Plan:** Step-by-step approach
     - **Benefits:** Why this is valuable
     - **Files to Modify:** Specific paths
     - **Estimated Effort:** Time estimate
     - **Implementation Priority:** High/Medium/Low
     - **Status:** 📋 Planned
     - **Date Added:** Current date
   - Append the new entry to the appropriate section
   - Use the Edit tool to add it

4. **Confirmation:**
   - Summarize what was added
   - Mention the section it was added to
   - Provide the priority and estimated effort

## Example Usage

```
User: /future add a feature to automatically detect when developers haven't pushed code in 3+ days
Assistant: [Asks clarifying questions, plans implementation, adds to FUTURE_WORK.md]
```

## Important Notes

- This command is for **improvements to the PM agent itself**, not for company product ideas
- For company product ideas, use `/idea` instead
- Always read FUTURE_WORK.md first to avoid duplicates
- Match the existing documentation style
- Be concise but comprehensive
